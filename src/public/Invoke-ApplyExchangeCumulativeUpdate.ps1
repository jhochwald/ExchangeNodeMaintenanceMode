			.SYNOPSIS
			Apply an Exchange Cumulative Update
	
			.DESCRIPTION
			Apply an Exchange Cumulative Update, with the optional AD and Schema updates,
			and additional UM language packs update.

			Please read the Release Notes from Microsoft carefully, some updates need an Active
			Directory schema and/or Active Directory and/or Active Directory domain updates.
			If this is the case, please use the "Prepare" Switch on ONE Node!

			Nevertheless, please keep in mind, that you do NOT need to run the command with this
			Switch more than once. However, even if, the Switch will not harm in any kind,
			it is just a waste of time, and the installation will take longer.

			.PARAMETER Source
			Source Directory of the Exchange Cumulative Update.
			Must exist.
	
			.PARAMETER Prepare
			Run prepare of Schema, Active Directory and AD Domain.
			You need to do this one one Node. the 2nd one could run the installer without it.
			Enabled by default
	
			.PARAMETER UMLangHandling
			Handle the UM Language(s).
			Disabled by default
	
			.PARAMETER UMLangSource
			Source Directory of the UM Language Pack(s).
			The Directory must exist!
	
			.PARAMETER UMLanguages
			UM Languages to handle.
			This is one string that should contain all languages.

			.NOTES
			TODO: Error handling. At the moment it is just a fire an forget thing!
	
			This function is just a wrapper for the default SETUP.EXE of the Exchange Cumulative 
			Update package and the UM Language Pack update(s).

			You might tweak the directory variable. Or just use the parameters to do so.

			Someone asked me: "Why not stopping the Windows Defender during the update? Defender will
			consume a lot of CPU." I agree; it will use some CPU during the update, but I'm not a fan
			of doing this. There is a reason for an Anti-Virus tool, by stopping the scan engine the
			system would be at risk! And this is something I don't want a system I'm responsible for!
			If you want to do something like this, this is your decision. However, I "highly" recommend
			not doing it. And this applies to all AV scanners on your servers!

			One last thing: Be patient if you install the Exchange Cumulative Update! The preparation
			(e.g. Schema, Active Directory and Domain) should be quick, even if you environment is
			distributed. The removal of the old installation and especially the update installation
			with the restart of all services might take a while to complete (depending on your
			hardware, it could be 30 minutes, or more!).
			Why this is important: During the installation, the other Node(s) needs to handle the load,
			and you might need to communicate, that you have the risk of a single point of failure.
