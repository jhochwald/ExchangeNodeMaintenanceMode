Exchange Cluster Node Maintenance Mode Utilities

## Description

Exchange Cluster Node Maintenance Mode Utilities

## Introduction

Apply an Exchange Cumulative Update, with the optional AD and Schema updates, and additional UM language packs update.Please read the Release Notes from Microsoft carefully, some updates need an Active Directory schema and/or Active Directory and/or Active Directory domain updates.If this is the case, please use the "Prepare" Switch on ONE Node!
Nevertheless, please keep in mind, that you do NOT need to run the command with this Switch more than once. However, even if, the Switch will not harm in any kind, it is just a waste of time, and the installation will take longer.

This module is tested with the PowerShell testing framework Pester. To run all
tests, just start the included test script `.\Build.ps1 -test` or invoke Pester
directly with the `Invoke-Pester` cmdlet in the tests directory. The tests will automatically download
the latest meta test from the claudiospizzi/PowerShellModuleBase repository.
